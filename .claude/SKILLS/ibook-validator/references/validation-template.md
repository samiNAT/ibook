| PRD acceptance <NNNN> |  | met / partial / missing |  |

### Scope drift

|              | yes / no       |      |

### Shipped but never requested
- <anything present that no spec or PRD line asked for>

## Pass two — fidelity

**PROBLEM:** <quote it> — is that person measurably less stuck?
<answer>

**SUCCESS:** <quote it> — count it. What is the number?
<answer>

**USER:** would that person recognise this as built for them?
<answer>

**NOT NOW:** did anything deferred get built anyway?
<answer>

**Would you write the same intent again?**
<answer>

## What surprised me
